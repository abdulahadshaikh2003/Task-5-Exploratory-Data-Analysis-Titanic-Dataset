# Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis – Titanic Dataset

## Objective
Perform exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to find patterns, trends, and anomalies.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Titanic Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/)
- Rows: ~891
- Columns: Passenger details, survival status, ticket class, fare, age, gender, etc.

## Tools Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Steps Performed
1. Data loading & inspection (`.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`)
2. Missing value analysis
3. Value counts for categorical variables
4. Univariate analysis (histograms, countplots)
5. Bivariate analysis (barplots, scatterplots)
6. Correlation heatmap & pairplot
7. Observations for each visual

## Key Insights
- Women had a higher survival rate than men.
- 1st class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Fare is positively correlated with survival rate.
- Most passengers were between 20–40 years old.
